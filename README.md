The channel experienced a significant surge in views, likes, and comments in 2020-2021, indicating a successful content strategy or campaign during that year.

- Decline Post-2021:
The decline in views, likes, and comments post-2021 suggests a potential shift in audience interests or a change in content strategy that may not be resonating with the audience.

- Engagement Rate:
The top-performing videos have high engagement rates, indicating that the audience is actively interacting with the content. This could be due to the relevance, quality, or presentation of the content.

- Content Strategy:
The top-performing videos may provide insights into the type of content that resonates with the audience, such as topics, formats, or styles.

# Recommendations
- Investigate the factors that contributed to the success in 2020 & 2021, such as content strategy, promotions, collaborations, and consider replicating those efforts.
- Continuously monitor the performance of the channel and adapt the content strategy as needed to ensure ongoing engagement and growth.
- Based on the decline post-2021, consider adjusting the content strategy to better resonate with the audience such as exploring new topics, formats, or styles.

# Conclusion
- This project analyzed the Google Small Business YouTube channel's performance, revealing key insights into views, engagement, and top-performing content. The findings can inform future content strategies, helping to optimize video performance and audience engagement.
